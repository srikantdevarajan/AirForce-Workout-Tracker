# AirForce-Workout-Tracker

## Motivation
Wanted to create an application my friends could use to prepare for the Air Force ROTC Physical Fitness Assessment. Decided to create a full stack web app that allows the user to add workouts, query the database for all their workouts, and look at graphs of their performance so they can visually see where they need to improve.
